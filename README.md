I'm currently working on a number of WordPress related projects 

- [Fizzie](https://github.com/bobbingwide/fizzie) - An experimental Full Site Editing theme for https://blocks.wp-a2z.org
- [SB-Chart-block](https://github.com/bobbingwide/sb-chart-block) - A single block plugin to display Charts from CSV content.
- [Slog](https://github.com/bobbingwide/slog) - An addon to my oik-bwtrace plugin to analyse daily trace summary reports.
- [Slog-bloat](https://github.com/bobbingwide/slog-bloat) - Comparing server side performance 

I have more open issues than closed issues.
